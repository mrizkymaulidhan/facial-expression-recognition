# Facial Expression Recognition Project

## Overview

The project focuses on developing a machine learning application dedicated to recognizing and categorizing human facial expressions into distinct emotional states. It aims to identify emotions like anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and neutrality from facial expressions. This is achieved by leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which excels in analyzing and interpreting facial features, enabling precise emotion recognition and classification.

## Features

- **Emotion Categorization**: The model is trained to distinguish between different emotional states based on facial expressions.
- **CNN Model**: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network for accurate analysis of facial features.
- **Multi-Class Classification**: Recognizes emotions across various categories, including anger, joy, fear, etc.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## Usage

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Gather a comprehensive dataset of facial expressions with labeled emotions.
2. **Model Training**: Train the CNN model using the prepared dataset to recognize emotional states from facial images.
3. **Evaluation and Testing**: Evaluate the model's performance and conduct testing to ensure accurate emotion recognition.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance model accuracy by gathering more diverse and extensive datasets.
- Implement real-time emotion recognition through live video feed processing.
- Experiment with different CNN architectures for improved performance.
